## Game Of Life Kata - Written in Python 3.7
This program used [PyTest 4.x](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) for unit testing
To install it run
```python
pip install -U pytest
```
I recommend to use python virtual enviroment [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) to create a virtual enviroment so PIP installation will not affect your other python projects.

to run the test switch to the files directory and run
```python
pytest
```
